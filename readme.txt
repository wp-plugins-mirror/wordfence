== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does Wordfence need an API key? =

Wordfence contacts our servers for a variety of reasons. These include: comparing the hashes of your core, theme and plugin files
against the official versions, checking if URL's in your comments, posts and files are on any known list of dangerous URL's, checking
if any of your file signatures match a large list of known malware files, and much more. 

= Will Wordfence slow my site down? =

We have spent a lot of time making sure Wordfence runs very quickly. Wordfence uses its own database
tables and advanced mysql features to ensure it runs as fast as possible. The creators of Wordfence
also run a large scale real-time analytics product and much of the technology and knowledge from
our real-time analytics products is built into Wordfence.

= How often is Wordfence updated? =

Wordfence is continually updated. That is the advantage of scanning using an API key that connects to a
web service. While we do provide updates to the Wordfence plugin frequently and it's important
that you install those updates, our web service is updated even more frequently with known 
security issues that Wordfence will scan for.

= What if I need support? =

All our paid customers receive priority support. Excellent customer service is a key part
of being a Wordfence member.

= Can I disable certain features of Wordfence? =

Yes! Simply visit the Options page, click on advanced options and enable or disable the features you want.
